# evohome-indigo-plugin
 Python 3 version of indigo plugin to support Honeywell Evohome to work with Indigo version 2023.1.0 onwards that requires all plugns to run in Python 3

This plugin was derived from the previous Honeywell plugin, and is a direct replacement functionally for that for european Evohome users. It utilises the Evohome python client
available https://github.com/watchforstock/evohome-client which only supports the European API calls.

If your Evhome Credentials work at https://international.mytotalconnectcomfort.com/Account/Login then you should be able to use the plugin. This will not work with the Wifi Thermostat or the Redlink Gateways used in the US.
